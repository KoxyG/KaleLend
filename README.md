# ReflectStake Tool

## Overview

ReflectStake Tool is an innovative staking platform that allows users to stake KALE tokens while dynamically adjusting the stake amount based on Reflector's price feed for KALE (or other paired assets like XLM). It automatically optimizes staking based on price fluctuations and provides transparent reward distribution, all through a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

### üéØ Price-Sensitive Staking Management
- Automatically adjust staking amounts based on the value of KALE tracked through Reflector's real-time price feed
- Stake more when the price of KALE rises and stake less when the price drops
- Allow users to set staking thresholds: e.g., "Increase my stake by 10% if the price goes up by 5%"

### üí∞ Dynamic Reward Calculation
- Adjust reward calculations dynamically based on the price of KALE
- Ensure users can earn optimal rewards when the price is high, and minimize losses when it's low
- Use Reflector's price feed to adjust reward allocations based on staking amount and market conditions

### üîî User Alerts and Notifications
- Receive notifications when the price of KALE moves beyond predefined thresholds
- Email, Discord, or Telegram alerts for significant price movements or reward updates
- Real-time alerts when stake adjustments are needed

### ‚öôÔ∏è Manual Override Option
- While the tool automatically adjusts staking, users can override automatic adjustments
- Manual staking management option for users who prefer full control

### üìä Stake and Reward History Dashboard
- Detailed records of staking history, including amounts staked and rewards earned
- Changes made based on price adjustments
- Real-time KALE price display tracking performance through Reflector's price feed

### üîÑ Cross-Asset Support
- Stake multiple assets (e.g., KALE, XLM) simultaneously
- Use Reflector to track price feeds for all assets
- Dynamically adjust staking of each asset based on respective price changes
